# Docker - PHP

[Docker PHP][1] is a **Docker and PHP** repository which accompanies [a YouTube tutorial][2].

Setup
------------

* For a standard build / setup, simply run
```docker compose up -d ```


Branches
-------------

Each branch (except main, dev, and branches prefixed with 'feature') corresponds to an accompanying series lesson.   

Contributing
------------

Docker PHP is an Open Source project and contributions are welcome. The 'main' branch is read-only as this should not differ from the tutorials so please send pull requests to the develop branch.
